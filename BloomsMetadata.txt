Metadata for analysis of Bloom’s Taxonomy levels for exams given in Bio 171: Introductory Biology: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan in Fall 2012 & Fall 2014. 

Cindee Giffen and Meghan Duffy assessed the Bloom’s taxonomy level of the exam questions, working from Key 1 of each exam. We assigned Bloom’s levels based on the following levels:
1 = Remember; basic recall
2 = Understand; e.g., given a new example, be able to recognize a concept covered in class
3 = Apply; e.g., recognizing what equation needed to be used, figuring out what information from the question goes into that equation, and correctly solving
4 = Analyze; give students completely new data that they have to interpret in light of the concepts covered; have students make predictions (either verbally or graphically) based on a novel scenario

Short answer questions are given numbers greater than 50. For these, we used the highest Bloom’s level of the different subquestions.

Lists the semester (Fall 2012 or Fall 2014), the exam (1-4), the question number, and the Bloom’s level of the question. Note that the order in which topics were covered differed between the two semesters, so exam 1 in Fall 2014 had different material on it than exam 1 did in Fall 2012. There was also a partial change in instructors and a dramatic change in pedagogical techniques. Those changes are described here: https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/late-semester-thoughts-on-flipping-the-classroom/
